# The code base was inherited from https://github.com/hmdolatabadi/denoising_diffusion, the scripts where changes were made have been included (diffusion_lightning.py -> train.py, 
# lib/diffusion.py -> diffusion.py, lib/model.py -> model.py)

# The checkpoints haven't been included in the submission due to their size. However the generated samples are present in the samples folder.
