## For Lokta Volterra and Rotation of images:

## Uses scipy.integrate.solve_ivp to attain trajectories of Rotation and Lotka Volterra simulations.

#### The 3 places where the code needs to be changed is marked in the script Rotation_lotka_volterra.py. Un-comment the section for using either Rotation or Lotka Volterra.

#### The lotka volterra hyper parameters can be changed by changing the values of alpha, beta, gamma and delta variable values.
